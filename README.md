# Advent of Code 2020

Me, trying to solve [a few puzzles](https://adventofcode.com) in Haskell

## Day 1

Given a text file (`Day1.txt`) that contains an integer in each line:

* **Task 1:** Find a pair of numbers that adds up to 2020, the result is their product
* **Task 2:** Find a triple of numbers that adds up to 2020, the result is their product
